# Algorand GREEN
Growing the Algorand blockchain by means of founding an accelerator.

The main thesis of this proposal is that Algorand should utilize it's USP's (unique selling points) to the fullest extent. This proposal includes plans for the Algorand GREEN accelerator, in which 5 stellar teams are sourced and set upon building awesome products on the Algorand blockchain.

Key points include insights on the gaps left by Toucan and KlimaDAO, how to source applicants, and what the budget for GREEN would look like.
